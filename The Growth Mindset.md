3. **Embrace Mindset Change**: Encourage a mindset shift towards a growth mindset, where individuals believe that abilities can be developed and improved through dedication and practice.

By fostering a growth mindset, we understand that errors and challenges are valuable opportunities for our brain to stay active and continuously expand its capabilities.

Remember, it's not about immediate perfection, but rather the journey of growth and improvement.

## why are linked lists used in programming?

Linked lists are used in programming because they offer dynamic size, efficient insertion and deletion, flexibility in data organization, memory management benefits, and serve as foundational data structures for more complex data structures. They are particularly useful for scenarios requiring frequent data modification and recursive data structures.

## linked list and complixity
Linked lists are commonly used in programming because they offer flexibility in managing and manipulating data dynamically. They are efficient for insertions and deletions at the beginning of the list, taking constant time (O(1)). However, accessing elements by position or performing operations at the end of the list can be less efficient, taking linear time (O(n)) as the list grows larger. Big O notation is used to analyze the time complexity of these operations. It provides an upper bound on the efficiency of algorithms or operations and helps programmers make informed decisions about data structures and algorithms to optimize performance.



## Linked List

1. **Linked List:**
   - *Definition:* A linear data structure consisting of a sequence of nodes, where each node contains data and a reference (or link) to the next node.

2. **Node:**
   - *Definition:* A fundamental building block of a linked list that stores data and contains a reference (or link) to the next node.

3. **Head:**
   - *Definition:* The first node in a linked list. It serves as the starting point for traversing the list.

4. **Tail:**
   - *Definition:* The last node in a linked list. It has a reference (or link) to NULL, indicating the end of the list.

5. **Singly Linked List:**
   - *Definition:* A type of linked list where each node contains a single reference to the next node.

6. **Doubly Linked List:**
   - *Definition:* A type of linked list where each node contains references to both the next node and the previous node.

7. **Circular Linked List:**
   - *Definition:* A type of linked list where the last node in the list has a reference to the first node, creating a circular structure.

8. **Traversal:**
   - *Definition:* The process of visiting each node in a linked list, typically to access or modify the data stored in the nodes.

9. **Insertion:**
   - *Definition:* The process of adding a new node to a linked list at a specific position or at the beginning or end of the list.

10. **Deletion:**
    - *Definition:* The process of removing a node from a linked list, which involves updating the references of adjacent nodes.

11. **Search:**
    - *Definition:* The process of finding a specific value or node within a linked list by traversing the list and comparing the data in each node.

12. **Empty Linked List:**
    - *Definition:* A linked list that does not contain any nodes. The head is usually NULL in an empty list.

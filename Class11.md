## Readings: Event Driven Applications


#### EventEmitter
Node.js natively provides us with a useful module called EventEmitter that allows us to get started incorporating Event-Driven Programming in our project right away. Of course, creating our own version of EventEmitter wouldnâ€™t be much of a challange, and in fact there are several modules published on npm such as EventEmitter2 and EventEmitter3 which promise a faster performance than the native EventEmitter.

#### Object Oriented Programming + Event-Driven Programming
The Object Oriented approach promotes the idea that all behavior of an individual unit (or object) be handled from code within that unit. Using this approach, applications are built with many different units that all speak to and interact with each other.

#### Event Driven Programming useful on the backend using Node.js

When you click a button or do something on a website, it triggers a specific action to happen. It makes websites interactive and responsive to what you're doing.

# 	Whiteboarding Tips & Strategies

**Speaker : Roger Huba**

Finished watching Whiteboarding Tips & Strategies, for Roger Huba.

The information in the video changed my way to approach a whiteboarding interview by:
1. Instead of fixating solely on resolving the code, refrain from immediately diving into programming and addressing the issue.
2. Emphasize greater attention towards communication, whereby you can still succeed in an interview if the interviewer appreciates your problem-solving approach and your adeptness in effectively conveying your thoughts, thus placing the interviewer in a challenging position as well.

## List key take-aways
- Hiring managers are not primarily interested in reviewing your code; they are keen to observe your problem-solving abilities, thought process, and logical reasoning.

- Demonstrating coachability and an open-mindedness towards different perspectives is crucial during interviews.
- Also, they want to see if you are a good fit in a team, you should ask for help when you need it.
- Additionally, interviewers assess whether you are a good fit for a team by evaluating your willingness to seek assistance when needed.

- Sometimes interviewers present challenging or unsolvable problems to evaluate your ability to break them down into smaller components and solve parts of the problem, rather than expecting a complete solution. Thus, it is important not to view every problem as a task to be fully solved.

- Avoid rushing into coding before completing other aspects of the whiteboard, as the code itself is not necessarily as significant as the other components.

- When encountering difficulties in problem-solving, always return to visualization techniques as they can provide a clear path forward.
